# Developing PocketTS

## The parts

- `tsproto/`: the TeamSpeak connection in plain Kotlin (no Android): packets, encryption, commands, the channel and
  people model, chat, file transfer and streams. Most of the tests are here.
- `app/`: the Android app, in Jetpack Compose: screens, voice (Opus), streams (WebRTC), settings and favourites.
- `scripts/dev.sh`: every build, test and helper command.
- `docs/TESTING.md`: what to test by hand on a phone.

## Building

Everything builds in Docker, so the only things needed are Docker and a Bash shell (on Windows: Docker inside
WSL). There's no need to install Java or the Android SDK.

```bash
ACCEPT_ANDROID_SDK_LICENSE=yes scripts/dev.sh image   # the build image: Java and the Android SDK (once)
scripts/dev.sh test                                   # tests
scripts/dev.sh apk                                    # a test build in dist/
scripts/dev.sh screenshots                            # pictures of the screens (example data) in docs/screenshots/
scripts/dev.sh gradle <task>                          # any other Gradle task
```

The build image accepts the Android SDK license, which is why that variable has to be set.

`dev.env` holds this computer's own settings (addresses, container names) and is never committed.

## Testing on a phone

`scripts/dev.sh devserver up` starts a small page on port 8686. Open `http://<this computer's address>:8686` on the
phone, tap the newest build and install it. Android asks once to allow installing apps from the browser.
`scripts/dev.sh devserver down` stops it.

Test builds send their log to that page (`dist/phone.log`) when `DEV_LOG_URL` is set in `dev.env`. Release builds
never do.

## Tests against a real server

`scripts/dev.sh it` connects two clients to a TeamSpeak server and checks the following:

- they see each other and each other's channel moves
- one hears exactly what the other sends
- chat messages arrive
- both leave cleanly

Put the test server's address in `dev.env` as `TS_TEST_SERVER=host:port`. If the server runs in a container, add
`TS_CONTAINER=<name>` as well, so `scripts/dev.sh ts-server up` and `down` can start and stop it.
